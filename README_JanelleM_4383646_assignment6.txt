CS3130 Assignment 6
Janelle Montgomery

A python program that uses Requests and BeautifulSoup4 to screen-scrape the contents of a certain financial website.The program will retrieve market information found on the Globe and Mail's financial website and present it to the user in a different format. The site www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-invester has market information ( S&P TSX, S&P 500, DOW
Jones, etc) on its webpage. 

This program will check if the selection you make from 1-8 is a number and correct and will prompt you for a response.

Please note you must have BeautifulSoup4 installed in order to use my program :)
